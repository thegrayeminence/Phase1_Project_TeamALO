We use The Beli App as our framework- https://beliapp.com/
Maybe 1 of our event listeners is hovering over the dish and the address pops up
Another event listener is "clicking" the dish and both the ingredients/description pops up but also a link to the website
3rd event listener is a form that people can submit their dish, restaurant, address, price, etc
Maybe we focus on 4 main "cuisines" - burgers, pasta, sandwiches, and soup (they are our body's in index.html)
